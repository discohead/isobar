## Regular Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly (During Team Meeting)
- [ ] Review any pattern violations caught by AI
- [ ] Discuss new patterns discovered
- [ ] Note any conflicting AI suggestions

### Monthly
- [ ] Run `/user:context-update` if significant changes

- [ ] Review Copilot instruction effectiveness
- [ ] Update team onboarding if needed

### Quarterly
- [ ] Full context refresh: `/user:context`
- [ ] Optimize all instruction files
- [ ] Review and update maintenance commands
- [ ] Audit AI suggestion quality

### Annually  
- [ ] Complete regeneration of all AI config
- [ ] Major version documentation update
- [ ] Team survey on AI effectiveness
- [ ] Plan improvements for next year

## Maintenance Commands

### Context Update
```bash
# After adding new features or patterns
/user:context-update
```

### Rule Synchronization
```bash
# After context update
/user:rules-sync
```

### Instruction Optimization
```bash
# When instructions get too large
/user:instructions-optimize
```

## Maintenance Checklist

### Before Updates
- [ ] Commit current work
- [ ] Note any custom modifications
- [ ] Backup current AI config (optional)

### During Updates
- [ ] Run appropriate command
- [ ] Review generated changes
- [ ] Test with simple examples
- [ ] Verify no regressions

### After Updates
- [ ] Commit AI config changes
- [ ] Update team on changes
- [ ] Monitor for issues
- [ ] Document any problems

## Signs That Maintenance Is Needed

1. **AI suggestions don't match code style**
   - Run context update
   
2. **Repeated pattern violations**
   - Update Cursor rules
   
3. **Copilot ignoring conventions**
   - Optimize instructions
   
4. **New team members confused**
   - Update onboarding docs

## Maintenance Log

Keep track of maintenance performed:

```markdown
## 2025-01-06
- Initial AI ecosystem setup complete
- Generated context, rules, and instructions
- Created maintenance schedule

## [Date]
- [What was done]
- [Why it was needed]
- [Results/Issues]
```

## Responsible Team Members

Assign team members to monitor:
- **Context Quality**: [Name]
- **Rule Effectiveness**: [Name]  
- **Instruction Optimization**: [Name]
- **Onboarding Updates**: [Name]

## Metrics to Track

1. **Code Quality**
   - Pattern violations per week
   - AI suggestion acceptance rate
   - Time to onboard new developers

2. **AI Effectiveness**
   - Useful vs. incorrect suggestions
   - Context lookup frequency
   - Rule trigger frequency

3. **Developer Satisfaction**
   - Quarterly survey results
   - Feature requests
   - Pain points

## Emergency Procedures

If AI configuration causes issues:

1. **Temporary Disable**
   ```bash
   # Rename config directories
   mv .cursor .cursor.bak
   mv .github/copilot-instructions.md .github/copilot-instructions.md.bak
   ```

2. **Report Issue**
   - Document what went wrong
   - Save error messages
   - Note recent changes

3. **Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Revert to last known good
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- .cursor .github claude
   ```

## Future Improvements

Track ideas for enhancement:
- [ ] Automate maintenance tasks
- [ ] Create validation scripts
- [ ] Build metrics dashboard
- [ ] Integrate with CI/CD
